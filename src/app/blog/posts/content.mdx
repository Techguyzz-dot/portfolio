## Company Branding

Your company's digital presence starts with strong branding. The `public/images/avatar.jpg` file serves as your company logo, appearing on the `/about` page and in dynamically generated `open-graph` images for social media sharing.

## Brand Identity

Replace the `src/app/favicon.ico` file with your company's favicon to maintain consistent branding across browser tabs.

## Content Management

The `resources/content.js` file is the central hub for managing your company's content. It supports custom components and dynamic content rendering, making it perfect for showcasing your tech company's services and expertise.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    highlight="1-2"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`import { InlineCode } from "@once-ui-system/core";
import Link from "next/link";

const company = {
  ...
};`,
    language: "tsx",
    label: "src/app/resources/content.js"
  }
]} />

The imports above enable the use of `InlineCode` and `Link` components in your content, perfect for showcasing code snippets and technical documentation.

### Company Profile

Your company profile is displayed throughout the website, from the header to the about page. This includes your company name, location, and primary services.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    highlight="2-3,7-10"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`const company = {
    name: "Tech Guyzz",
    role: "Software Development Company",
    avatar: "/images/avatar.jpg",
    location: "Asia/Kolkata", // Company headquarters timezone
    languages: ["English", "Hindi"], // Languages supported by your team
};`,
    language: "tsx",
    label: "src/app/resources/content.js"
  }
]} />

### Social Media Integration

Connect your company's social media presence through the `social` object. This helps build your company's online presence and makes it easy for potential clients to find you.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`const social = [
    {
      name: "GitHub",
      icon: "github",
      link: "https://github.com/techguyzz",
    },
    {
      name: "LinkedIn",
      icon: "linkedin",
      link: "https://www.linkedin.com/company/techguyzz",
    },
    {
      name: "Twitter",
      icon: "twitter",
      link: "https://twitter.com/techguyzz",
    }
];`,
    language: "tsx",
    label: "src/app/resources/content.js"
  }
]} />

### Service Pages

Each section of your website has its own configuration object, allowing you to showcase different aspects of your tech company, from services to case studies.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`const services = {
    label: "Services",
    title: "Tech Guyzz - Software Development Solutions",
    description: "Leading software development company specializing in custom solutions and digital transformation",
    headline: <>Transforming Ideas into Powerful Software Solutions</>,
    subline: (
      <>
        We are Tech Guyzz, a software development company dedicated to delivering innovative
        <br /> solutions that drive business growth and digital transformation.
      </>
    ),
};`,
    language: "tsx",
    label: "src/app/resources/content.js"
  }
]} />

The `label` property defines the navigation menu item, while `title` and `description` are used for SEO and social media sharing. These elements are crucial for establishing your company's online presence and attracting potential clients.
