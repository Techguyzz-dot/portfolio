## Content Management

Our blog system allows you to create, edit, and manage technical content using MDX files in the `src/app/blog/posts` directory. This system is perfect for sharing technical insights, development updates, and company news.

## Content Structure

Each blog post requires frontmatter metadata to properly display and index the content. This includes the title, publication date, featured image, and relevant tags.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    codes={[
      {
        code:
`---

tag: "Web Development"
---`,
        language: "tsx",
        label: "src/app/blog/posts/nextjs-architecture.mdx"
      }
    ]}
/>

## Technical Writing with MDX

Our blog system uses MDX, which combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components. This allows our technical writers to:
- Write clear, structured content
- Include interactive code examples
- Embed technical diagrams and visualizations
- Create dynamic, engaging technical documentation

## Component Integration

Our blog system comes with pre-built components specifically designed for technical content. These components are automatically available in all blog posts.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    highlight="11-12"
    codes={[
      {
        code:
`const components = {
    // Basic text elements
    p: createParagraph as any,
    h1: createHeading(1) as any,
    h2: createHeading(2) as any,
    h3: createHeading(3) as any,
    h4: createHeading(4) as any,
    h5: createHeading(5) as any,
    h6: createHeading(6) as any,
    
    // Technical content components
    CodeBlock, // For code examples
    Table,     // For data tables
    Diagram,   // For technical diagrams
    API,       // For API documentation
};`,
        language: "tsx",
        label: "src/components/mdx.tsx"
      }
    ]}
/>

These components are specifically designed for technical content, making it easy to:
- Display code snippets with syntax highlighting
- Create interactive API documentation
- Include technical diagrams and flowcharts
- Present data in structured tables

## Development Workflow

Our blog system supports a modern development workflow:
1. Write content in MDX format
2. Preview changes in real-time
3. Review and edit content
4. Deploy automatically through our CI/CD pipeline
