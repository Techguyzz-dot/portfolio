At Tech Guyzz, we maintain a robust component library that helps us deliver consistent, high-quality user interfaces across all our projects. Our components are built with React and TypeScript, ensuring type safety and maintainability.

## Component Showcase

Here's a showcase of some of our most commonly used components:

### Feedback Component

Use our feedback component to display important messages to users, such as success notifications, warnings, or error messages.

<Column fillWidth gap="-1" marginBottom="16" marginTop="8">
<CodeBlock
    radius="none"
    topRadius="l"
    codeHeight={24}
    codePreview={<Feedback icon title="Success" variant="success" description="Your changes have been saved successfully." marginBottom="24"/>}
    codes={[
      {
        code:
`<Feedback
    icon
    variant="success"
    title="Success"
    description="Your changes have been saved successfully."
/>`,
        language: "tsx",
        label: "Feedback Component"
      }
    ]}
/>
</Column>

### Data Tables

Our table component is perfect for displaying structured data with sorting and filtering capabilities.

<Column fillWidth gap="-1" marginBottom="16" marginTop="8">
<CodeBlock
    radius="none"
    topRadius="l"
    codePreview={
    <Table 
      data={{
        headers: [
          { content: "Service", key: "service", sortable: true },
          { content: "Technology", key: "tech", sortable: true },
          { content: "Description", key: "description" }
        ],
        rows: [
          ["Web Development", "React/Next.js", "Modern web applications with server-side rendering"],
          ["Mobile Apps", "React Native", "Cross-platform mobile applications"],
          ["Backend Services", "Node.js/Python", "Scalable API and microservices"],
          ["Cloud Solutions", "AWS/Azure", "Cloud infrastructure and deployment"]
        ]
      }}
    />}
    codes={[
      {
        code:
`<Table 
    data={{
      headers: [
        { content: "Service", key: "service", sortable: true },
        { content: "Technology", key: "tech", sortable: true },
        { content: "Description", key: "description" }
      ],
      rows: [
        ["Web Development", "React/Next.js", "Modern web applications with server-side rendering"],
        ["Mobile Apps", "React Native", "Cross-platform mobile applications"],
        ["Backend Services", "Node.js/Python", "Scalable API and microservices"],
        ["Cloud Solutions", "AWS/Azure", "Cloud infrastructure and deployment"]
      ]
    }}
/>`,
        language: "tsx",
        label: "Table Component"
      }
    ]}
/>
</Column>

### Code Documentation

Our code documentation components help you showcase code snippets with syntax highlighting and interactive features.

<Column fillWidth gap="-1" marginBottom="16" marginTop="8">
<CodeBlock
    radius="none"
    topRadius="l"
    codes={[
      {
        code:
`// Example of a React component
import React from 'react';

interface ButtonProps {
  label: string;
  onClick: () => void;
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary';
}

export const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({
  label,
  onClick,
  variant = 'primary'
}) => {
  return (
    <button 
      className={\`btn btn-\${variant}\`}
      onClick={onClick}
    >
      {label}
    </button>
  );
};`,
        language: "tsx",
        label: "Component Example"
      }
    ]}
/>
</Column>

Our accordion component is perfect for FAQs, documentation, and other expandable content.

<Column fillWidth gap="-1" marginBottom="16" marginTop="8">

    radius="none"
    topRadius="l"
    codePreview={
      <AccordionGroup 
        items={[
